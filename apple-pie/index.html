      <p class="titulo">Apple Pies This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
        be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
        favorites as well!

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <a>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees
              C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
              to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
              slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
              that it does not run off. </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
              degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</a>
